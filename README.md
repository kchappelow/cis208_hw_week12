Problem: The *Rectangle* Class

Following the example of the *Circle* class in Section 9.2, design a class named *Rectangle* to represent a rectangle.

The class contains:
* Two *double* data fields named *width* and *height* that specify the width and height of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both *width* and *height*.
* A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
* A constructor that creates a default rectangle.
* A method name *getArea()* that returns the are of this rectangle.
* A method named *getPerimeter()* that returns the perimeter.

Task #1: Draw the UML diagram using PlantUML for the class.

Task #2: Write a test program that creates two *Rectangle* objects - one with width *4* and height *40* and
the other with width *3.5* and height *35.9*. Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in that order.

Task #3: Submit the UML class diagram, the class, and test program using git.
